Hi, I'm Sakshi — a passionate and curious 2nd-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in software development and technology. I’ve gained a solid understanding of Java and JVM internals, and have worked extensively with SQL for database operations.

On the frontend, I’ve built a foundation in HTML and CSS, and I’m currently learning Dart along with the Flutter framework to expand my development skills. I'm also comfortable using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

Beyond technical skills, I take pride in my leadership abilities and presentation skills — whether it’s guiding a team during college projects or delivering ideas with clarity and confidence.

I’m focused on building meaningful projects, growing my skill set, and connecting with like-minded people in tech. Always open to learning, collaborating, and evolving!
